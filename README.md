# dva_project: House Price Prediction     

## Introduction   
The real estate market has experienced tremendous growth over the past ten years and remains highly attractive for consumers, businesses, and investors alike. Due to the high demand and low supply in the real estate market (Zhao, 2020), the transaction goes faster due to the macroeconomics environment (Marfatia, 2020), and it is significant to understand the industry operational mechanism. Therefore, this project aims to use big data and build robust machine learning algorithms to predict average house prices in areas to assist house buyers and agents make offers easily.     

## Motivation     
How can we assist potential homeowners and agents get a general idea about the house price at the area buyers are interested in and the house prices at its adjacent areas to help buyers find house prices on budget. Our machine learning algorithm can also help buyers get a reasonable average house price by area to avoid selling homes at a significant loss.        

## Proposed Method   
Our approach to predicting average house prices is a combination of big data and machine learning algorithms. The data includes the room numbers, room types, geographic location, median household income, and criminal rate. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization with SQL, Tableau, and Python assist us in having a comprehensive understanding of the house data, and machine learning techniques can conclude a pattern behind millions of sales data. We would try different machine learning algorithms with model ensembles to produce a satisfying prediction.    
    
Our models can be separated into two steps: different Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost will be trained in the first step; secondly, the outputs from step 1 models will be the inputs of ensemble modeling. Linear Regression includes Lasso regression and Ridge regression. What is more, different loss functions of Neural Network and XGBoost models will be trained and tested. It is expected that linear models do not achieve satisfactory results, but they help explain relationships among the features during ensemble modeling.    

## Data Source
Our data comes from one of the most famous compeititions in Kaggle. You can download the dataset from Zillow directly after you sign up in Kaggle. There are five csv in the competition but we only use properties_2016.csv and properties_2017.csv.
